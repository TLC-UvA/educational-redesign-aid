      Offline, lecturers offer a wide variety of 1-on-1 supervision, from individual assignments to thesis and internship supervision.The lecturer’s focus is to provide support and feedback and to assess each student’s progress and final level. Along the road, the lecturer tailors his teaching approach to the students’ needs. The goals for students are to <em><strong>assess their progress and deficiencies</strong></em> to meet the <em><strong>course goals</strong></em>. Let’s take this online!

<li>Appropriate 1-on-1 supervision depends on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the level of student’s independence. This also affects the type of activities to provide them with feedback and support, assess student’s progress and their final level. Typically assessment formats include a thesis, field report, oral presentation, or oral exam. Your department likely has a well-documented procedure for the assignment requirements and associated rubric for grading, so be sure to have that in-hand from the beginning.</li>
<li>To meet with your student along the way, you can schedule a Zoom meeting on a regular basis. In the meantime you can stay available by email or through an open office hour for all (<a href="/small/office_hours/">see the page Office Hours</a>).</li>

          <p>Online teaching requires more effort to stay connected to your students. In addition, students may feel disconnecting to the university, the program, and their fellow students. Students may experience different kinds of issues like lack of facilities, stamina, or social competencies to thrive in an online learning environment. Organising short Live Chat sessions or opening up a Discussion Board and responding on set times, helps to increase the sense of belonging, support and your accessibility to your students. Structuring when and where they should talk to each other helps them too.</p>
<p>That said, online teaching doesn’t mean you’re available all day and night to accommodate students. You have a life too :). Online tools can help you with this too. For example, if students upvote a question in the Discussion Board, you can address high priority issues first. By scheduling your presence and communicating to your students when and where they can reach you, you can enjoy your well-deserved evenings and weekends.</p>

<li>Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas to announce the topics of the week and address (upvoted) questions based on the Discussion Board. This can be a way to quickly address all issues and personalize your interaction with more students at once.</li>
<li>Provide a Zoom office session or a Canvas Live Chat shortly after a lecture, seminar or workgroup. Students are often still in a learning mode and may have questions they don’t want to address in the general Zoom session (like in an offline setting).</li>
