      <title>Why do this</title>

      <description>Interaction through an online plenary Zoom session is often more difficult to achieve. Students tend to fall back into ‘watching tv mode’ (passive processing). By raising and upvoting questions prior to the interactive session, your students are more engaged and in ‘learning mode’ (active processing). You can augment this with Zoom polls to provide your guest with the opportunity to get to know the audience and interact with them in a fast and efficient way.</description>

      <description>Add a cliff-hanger to the pre-recorded one-on-one interview. For example, if your guest has a real life example, don’t tell the end of the story yet until the live session. Use the Canvas Discussion Board to ask students what they would do next, before your guest continues the story. Add a short quiz to the introduction video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess students’ understanding of the subject matter, to have your guest raise a question, or to have students think about what they would do in a real life example.</description>
