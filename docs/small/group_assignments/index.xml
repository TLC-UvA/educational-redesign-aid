      <description>Typically, group results are presented in class presentations, group reports or other collaborative products.
LIVE GROUP PRESENTATIONS  Provide or pre-record (with PowerPoint) your instructions for a live group presentation session and upload this to Canvas. You can explain how the live session is structured, what you expect students to do, and how the grading procedure works. Set up your grading rubrics in Canvas SpeedGrader.

      <description>LIVE GROUP PRESENTATION Live sessions help your students to stay connected to the course and each other. But, attending online live sessions takes up a lot of the participants’ energy, including your own. Therefore, your online sessions are shorter and with more breaks in between than in an offline setting. By preparing a rubric using SpeedGrader you can instantly assess your students in an efficient manner and students get their ‘just-in-time-feedback’.</description>

      <description>Live Presentations: Take advantage of the online setting to increase student engagement and peer feedback. Let students provide one compliment, one suggestion for improvement, and/or one question in the chat after each presentation. Live Presentations: Assign student roles to generate questions and lead a discussion after a few presentations. Use the SpeedGrader audio feedback tool in Canvas. For each student, you can record an audio message with the main feedback point.</description>
