      <description>Provide students with lectures for viewing on Canvas. You have two options here: pre-recorded or new recording. Choose pre-recorded (i.e., using existing recordings from lecture hall) if the technical quality is good enough and if the content still meets your goal. Otherwise, opt for a new recording. For both, you want to focus on smaller segments as opposed to one lengthy video. Aim for a maximum of 15-minutes per video and 45 minutes of total content to replace a 2-hour lecture.</description>

      <title>Why do this</title>

      <description>With large groups, a live Zoom session is less feasible. Students might encounter technical problems which prevent them from (completely) following a live session and there are limits to the number of students that can participate in a Zoom-session. Therefore pre-recorded lectures are the way to go.
We advise you not to copy-paste weblectures as they are, since this has been a source of complaints by students. Instead, we recommend that you check the quality first and then select segments, based on subtopics, that are most valuable for your learning goals.</description>

      <description>Add a short quiz to your video with Feedback Fruits to assess studentsâ€™ understanding of the subject matter. This way you activate your students while they watch your videos and foster information processing. Plus, you finally get feedback on what students (mis)understand. Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce the topics of the week and link it to the previous week.</description>
