      <description>Your options here are either a mixed (pre-recorded + live) or completely live seminar. Your decision is best made on the basis of your own personal style and the content you are working with. In general, we recommend the mixed approach so that your live portions capitalize on opportunities for student engagement and interaction. In both cases, we aim for a total of 90-minutes of content time (plus breaks).
MIXED APPROACH  Pre-record content with Powerpoint (15 minutes).</description>

      <title>Why do this</title>

      <description>The mixed option (our preferred approach) ensures that you don’t have to spend much time on instruction during the live session in Zoom and, instead, students can spend more time working on an assignment in the breakout rooms. But, if you want to explain (more) subject matter in an interactive way, then definitely go the complete Live approach.
Breakout Rooms can be very effective to engage, practice, discuss, and collaborate in subgroups.</description>

      <description>Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce this week’s seminar and link it to the previous week. You can also use this to address questions posted by students on Canvas after the last seminar. Add teaching assistants to supervise the breakout rooms and increase the hands-on feedback. Add individual practical assignments prior to the Zoom session (student self-study), so students can compare, share and discuss their findings in the Breakout Rooms.</description>
