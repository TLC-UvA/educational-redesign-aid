- Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas to announce the topics of the week and address (upvoted) questions based on the Discussion Board. This can be a way to quickly address all issues and personalize your interaction with more students at once.
- Provide a Zoom office session or a Canvas Live Chat shortly after a lecture, seminar or workgroup. Students are often still in a learning mode and may have questions they donâ€™t want to address in the general Zoom session (like in an offline setting).
