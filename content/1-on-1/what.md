- Appropriate 1-on-1 supervision depends on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the level of student’s independence. This also affects the type of activities to provide them with feedback and support, assess student’s progress and their final level. Typically assessment formats include a thesis, field report, oral presentation, or oral exam. Your department likely has a well-documented procedure for the assignment requirements and associated rubric for grading, so be sure to have that in-hand from the beginning.
- To meet with your student along the way, you can schedule a Zoom meeting on a regular basis. In the meantime you can stay available by email or through an open office hour for all ([see the page Office Hours](/small/office_hours/)).
