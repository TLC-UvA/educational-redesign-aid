Online teaching requires more effort to stay connected to your students. In addition, students may feel disconnecting to the university, the program, and their fellow students. Students may experience different kinds of issues like lack of facilities, stamina, or social competencies to thrive in an online learning environment. Organising short Live Chat sessions or opening up a Discussion Board and responding on set times, helps to increase the sense of belonging, support and your accessibility to your students. Structuring when and where they should talk to each other helps them too.

That said, online teaching doesn’t mean you’re available all day and night to accommodate students. You have a life too :). Online tools can help you with this too. For example, if students upvote a question in the Discussion Board, you can address high priority issues first. By scheduling your presence and communicating to your students when and where they can reach you, you can enjoy your well-deserved evenings and weekends.
