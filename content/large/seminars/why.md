The mixed option (our preferred approach) ensures that you don’t have to spend much time on instruction during the live session in Zoom and, instead, students can spend more time working on an assignment in the breakout rooms. But, if you want to explain (more) subject matter in an interactive way, then definitely go the complete Live approach.

Breakout Rooms can be very effective to engage, practice, discuss, and collaborate in subgroups. As with offline settings, you can visit each group to see how they are doing and to make sure they are still on task. With the Canvas Collaboration tool, students work together in one Google doc per breakout room and you can track their progress. By adding a short assignment to the Breakout Room session for the final plenary reflection, you increase the students’ focus in the breakout rooms.
