- Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce this week’s seminar and link it to the previous week. You can also use this to address questions posted by students on Canvas after the last seminar.
- Add teaching assistants to supervise the breakout rooms and increase the hands-on feedback.
- Add individual practical assignments prior to the Zoom session (student self-study), so students can compare, share and discuss their findings in the Breakout Rooms.
- If you use the mixed option, add a short quiz to a pre-recorded instruction video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess students’ understanding of the subject matter or to raise a question. This way you activate your students while prior to the seminar. Plus, you get feedback on what students (mis)understand and provide them with feedback during the seminar.
- Add team competition to the Breakout Rooms. Let them work on a topic and find out which team has the best results with a quiz in the final plenary setting.
