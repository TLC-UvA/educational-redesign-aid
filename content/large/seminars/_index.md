title: "Seminars"
description: "Offline, a seminar (in Dutch: Werkcollege) typically starts with some instructions and continues with supervised hands-on practice for around 30-50 students. The lecturer’s focus is on structured guidance, providing feedback and stimulating collaborative learning. The goals for students are to ***process and apply the subject matter*** and to ***experience supervised practice***. Let’s take this online!"
