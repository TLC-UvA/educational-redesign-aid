Learning to the test is common practice in student behavior (and human behavior). If that’s the case, it’s important to have the test meet your standards. At the same time, online practices require additional trustworthy procedures for both you, your students and the institution. Always contact your faculty’s ICTO support staff for more information about assessment tools (specifically for exams) available at your faculty. The ICTO team helps you in making the right technical choices and provides support before and during exams.

In some cases, the exam committee needs to get involved too. If you decide to make changes to your current offline assessment procedure, for example because you want to use an open book exam, replace an exam with individual assignments or because you want to change the extent to which the exam counts towards the final mark, you need permission of your examination board and your programme director.
