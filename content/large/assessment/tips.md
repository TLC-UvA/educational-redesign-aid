- Peer-feedback increases the amount of feedback for students. Sidenote, it often doesnâ€™t save the lecturer time as he/she has a different role to fulfill; providing feedback on the peer-feedback. If you leave out this part, students often tend to underestimate the value of peerfeedback and perceive it as ineffective additional work. A plenary Zoom session or pre-recorded video to discuss the best feedback and your general view on the products (main mistakes, issues, things to attend), helps to overcome these issues.
- Use the SpeedGrader audio feedback tool in Canvas. For each student, you can record an audio message with the main feedback point. This is a fast way and provides a personal touch to your feedback.
- Consider adding a rubric to your assessment to make grading more consistent between different graders, to speed up grading, and to give students insight into how their grades came into being. Setting up a new rubric is a time-investment, but in the long run it can save you a lot of time.
