- Schedule a weekly Canvas Live-Chat session of 30-45 min for students to raise questions. Students can then review the questions and answers of other students too. This can be tricky if you have MANY students trying to ask questions at the same time, in which you might set up 2 x 25 minutes sessions with half students assigned to each session; or if available, you might opt to do this separately by smaller workgroups.
- Alternatively, and potentially easier for very large classes, open a Canvas Discussion Board for students to raise and upvote questions. Answer them on set times each week.
