Check out these instruction videos on how to [record and save your presentation](https://youtu.be/JhKynNJUAIo) and [how to upload it on Canvas](https://youtu.be/9ltM3nLcwJ0) made by Fam te Poel (UvA TLC). Mac users can only record audio, not video. If you prefer to use video with your presentation we suggest you use Kaltura Capture (see below).
