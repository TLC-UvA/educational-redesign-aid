With large groups, a live Zoom session is less feasible. Students might encounter technical problems which prevent them from (completely) following a live session and there are limits to the number of students that can participate in a Zoom-session. Therefore pre-recorded lectures are the way to go.

We advise you not to copy-paste weblectures as they are, since this has been a source of complaints by students. Instead, we recommend that you check the quality first and then select segments, based on subtopics, that are most valuable for your learning goals. In addition, we recommend that your videos are shorter and the total recorded content is less compared to an offline setting. Pre-recorded videos may take up a lot of energy for you to produce and for your students to watch. So keep it feasible for both you and your students. You want your students to process the content and view each video with enough headspace too. The shorter the videos, the more video content students will actually watch. Plus, the longer the videos, the larger the file size, the upload time, and playback time. At the same time, let’s be pragmatic - sometimes things take a bit longer to explain and some segments will be longer than 15 min. Don’t let that ruin your day (or night).

When you add viewing instructions you encourage your students to watch the videos in a ‘learning mode’ (active processing) instead of a tv mode’ (passive processing). By adding a Discussion Board, you also leave room for questions and answers. Furthermore, it provides you with feedback on what to address further. A Discussion Board does need some encouragement for your students to participate. For example, encouraging upvotes, active responses to their questions, and showing that you’re there from time to time all encourages participation. Addressing the most upvoted questions in your next lecture is particularly encouraging for students, too.
