- Add a cliff-hanger to the first interview. For example, if your guest has a real life example, don’t tell the end of the story until the second interview.
- Add a short quiz to your video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess students’ understanding of the subject matter, to have your guest raise a question, or to have students think about what they would do in a real life example before your guest continues a story. This way you activate your students while they watch the interview and foster information processing. Plus, you and your guest receive feedback on what students (mis)understand.
