With large groups, a live Zoom session is less feasible. Students might encounter technical problems which prevent them from (completely) following a live session and there are limits to the number of students that can participate in a Zoom-session. Therefore pre-recorded lectures are the way to go.

Ideally, your students watch the (full) interview in a ‘learning mode’ (active processing) instead of a ‘watching tv mode’ (passive processing). This may take up a lot of your students’ energy. Therefore, we recommend cutting the interview in segments. This way, your students can process the content and view each video with enough headspace. Plus, the longer the videos, the larger the file size, the upload time and playback time. At the same time, don’t worry all night if a video is longer than 15 min. When you add viewing instructions you encourage your students to watch the videos in a ‘learning mode’ too. A Discussion Board and a second interview allows your students to ‘engage’ with your guest and the content. Nothing is more frustrating in life than an unanswered question ;).
