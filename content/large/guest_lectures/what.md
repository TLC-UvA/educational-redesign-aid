1. Record a one-on-one interview using Zoom. Aim for a maximum interview of 30-45 minutes.
2. If possible, cut the recording in segments based on (sub)topics of 15 min max.
3. Upload the interview to Canvas for viewing as part of structured self-study. Add clear instructions for your students. For example, indicate when students should watch it, add a question, what to look for and/or and what they should be able to do or know afterwards. This way you activate your students while they watch the interview.
4. Provide a Discussion Board in Canvas for students to add comments and ask questions after viewing (each segment). Next, invite students to upvote their favorite questions and comments. Consider awarding a bonus point for forum contributions and/or upvotes.
5. Record a second interview with your guest-speaker of 30-45 min. Have him or her address the most upvoted questions and comments from the Discussion Board.
