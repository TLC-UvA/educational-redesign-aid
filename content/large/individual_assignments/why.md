Clear assignments with useful feedback during a course are one of the most effective educational tools you have to teach your students. In both online and offline settings, assignments with feedback 1) provide an opportunity for your students to practice and to process the subject matter (students’ learning), 2) help your students to determine whether they are on track or should adjust what and how they are studying (students’ self-regulation), and 3) provide you with necessary information on your students’ understanding, progress and content related difficulties (teaching regulation). Assignments with feedback may even be more important in an online educational setting as students often miss out on informal meet-ups with peers and you to discuss difficulties or track their progress. The same goes for you. It may be difficult to keep track or stay connected to your students from a distance and determine what they need and when they need it. Assignments with feedback may help you to be the conductor of an orchestra from a distance.
