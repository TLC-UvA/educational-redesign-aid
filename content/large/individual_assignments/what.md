Appropriate assignments depend on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the number of students enrolled. There are many options to consider, such as short response papers, quizzes, adjusted field work and problem solving assignments. The same goes for assessment formats. Typically, they include essays, reports, presentations, skills tests, open-ended or multiple choice exams. We recommend that you review our Assessments Documentation to learn more about the digital varieties for each of the assignment and assessment options, and then determine what is most appropriate for your course. Here, you can also find information on when to run changes by your exam committee and how/when to get your ICTO support team involved. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.
