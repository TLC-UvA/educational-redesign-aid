Typically, group results are presented in class presentations, group reports or other collaborative products.

#### LIVE GROUP PRESENTATIONS
1. Provide or pre-record (with PowerPoint) your instructions for a live group presentation session and upload this to Canvas. You can explain how the live session is structured, what you expect students to do, and how the grading procedure works.
2. Set up your grading rubrics in Canvas SpeedGrader.
3. Schedule a live Zoom session of max 90 minutes in Canvas.
4. Let your students present their findings (10 min max) live in Zoom, group by group. Provide 10 min breaks after 30 minutes.
5. Grade the presentations in Canvas SpeedGrader.
6. Alternatively, you might have too many students to conduct live presentations within one timeslot or other challenges that make live presentations inappropriate for your class. In that case, you can have students present their presentation in Canvas, see below.

#### CANVAS GROUP PRESENTATIONS/REPORTS/PRODUCTS
1. Provide written or pre-recorded PowerPoint instructions for the assignment and upload this to Canvas. You can explain what you expect students to do and how the grading procedure works.
2. In case of presentations, have your students record their presentation with Powerpoint.
3. Let your students submit their presentation, reports, or showcase their product in Canvas Assignments.
4. Set up your grading rubrics in Canvas SpeedGrader.
5. Provide feedback with SpeedGrader in Canvas. Alternatively, you can use Feedback Fruits to provide (peer)feedback in a great interactive manner.
6. Grade your students in Canvas SpeedGrader with rubrics.
