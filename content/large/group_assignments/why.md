#### LIVE GROUP PRESENTATION
Live sessions help your students to stay connected to the course and each other. But, attending online live sessions takes up a lot of the participants’ energy, including your own. Therefore, your online sessions are shorter and with more breaks in between than in an offline setting. By preparing a rubric using SpeedGrader you can instantly assess your students in an efficient manner and students get their ‘just-in-time-feedback’.

#### CANVAS GROUP PRESENTATIONS/REPORTS/PRODUCTS
Using Canvas to showcase and grade group assignments can be very efficient and effective. Adding a rubric to your assignment makes grading more consistent between different graders, helps to speed up grading, and to give students insight into how their grades came into being. Setting up a new rubric is a time-investment, but in the long run it can save you a lot of time.

You have various tools available to provide peer-feedback in an interactive manner too. Peer-feedback can increase the amount of valuable feedback for students. Note that it often doesn’t save the lecturer too much time as he/she has a different role to fulfill; providing feedback on the peer-feedback. If you leave out this part, students often tend to underestimate the value of peerfeedback and perceive it as ineffective additional work. A plenary Zoom session or pre-recorded video in which you discuss the best feedback and your general view on the products (main mistakes, issues, things to attend), helps to overcome these issues.
