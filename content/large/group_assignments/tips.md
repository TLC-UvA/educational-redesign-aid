- Live Presentations: Take advantage of the online setting to increase student engagement and peer feedback. Let students provide one compliment, one suggestion for improvement, and/or one question in the chat after each presentation.
- Live Presentations: Assign student roles to generate questions and lead a discussion after a few presentations.
- Use the SpeedGrader audio feedback tool in Canvas. For each student, you can record an audio message with the main feedback point. This is a fast way and provides a personal touch to your feedback.
- After a Canvas group assignment (and peer-feedback), set up a plenary Zoom session or record a video in which you discuss the best feedback and your general view on the products (main mistakes, issues, things to attend). This speeds up the feedback process. In case of peer-feedback students know youâ€™re monitoring the process. With Feedback Fruits you can also provide (peer)feedback on skills.
