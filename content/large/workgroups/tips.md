- Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce this week’s workgroup and link it to the previous week. You can also use this to address questions posted by students on Canvas after the last workgroup.
- Have students introduce themselves on the Canvas Discussion Board. This saves you time during the live Zoom session. You can let them be creative and use their favorite social media (e.g., an instagram or facebook post, a video or a selfie with text).
- Add a short quiz to a pre-recorded instruction video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess students’ understanding of the subject matter or to raise a question. This way you activate your students prior to the workgroup. Plus, you get feedback on what students (mis)understand and provide them with feedback during the workgroup. Alternatively, you can add individual practical assignments prior to the Zoom session, so students can compare, share and discuss their findings in the Breakout Rooms.
- Assign student roles in the Breakout Rooms and have them take the lead.
- Have students work on related topics and teach the group about their findings in the final plenary setting. You can add and adjust the details after each short presentation.
- Add team competition to the Breakout Rooms. Let them work on a topic and find out which team has the best results with a quiz in the final plenary setting.
