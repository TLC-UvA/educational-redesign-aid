We recommend a mixed approach for workgroups (pre-recorded + live) so that your live portions capitalize on opportunities for student engagement and interaction. We aim for a total of 90-minutes of content time (plus breaks).

1. Pre-record your instructions and short presentation with Powerpoint (10 minutes). Upload this to Canvas for students to view prior to the seminar. You can also explain what you expect students to do in the breakout rooms and what they should deliver at the end (they can’t see your instructional slides in a breakout room).
2. Schedule a live Zoom session of 90 minutes in Canvas.
3. Use the first 10 minutes for introduction and to answer any questions about the instructions.
4. Use Zoom Breakout Rooms to divide students into subgroups. Use 25 minutes to collaborate and practice key skills (e.g., with the Canvas Collaboration tool). Assign (or have students assign) one group member who will report back on their findings after the breakout room session. Take a mid-point check (10 minutes) as a full group to check-in on progress and questions, followed by a 10-minute break. Then continue with another 25-minute breakout session to continue with in-class work.
5. Use the final 10 minutes to reflect on the assignment in a plenary interactive setting (e.g., each group presents their findings, or posts a conclusion or question in the chat).
6. If applicable to your content, use Canvas Discussion Board, Collaborations or Live Chat sessions to facilitate student interaction and collaboration during and in-between workgroups.
