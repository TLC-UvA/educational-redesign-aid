title: "Workgroups"
description: "Offline, a workgroup (in Dutch: Werkgroep) with up to 25-30 students provides the opportunity for students to fully engage with the subject matter and each other. The lecturer’s focus is on providing practice and feedback, elicit discussions, and support collaborative learning, not so much on direct instruction. The goals for students are to ***process and analyze the subject matter*** and to experience ***hands-on practice and discussion***. Let’s take this online!"
