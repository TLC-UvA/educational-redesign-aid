- Organise a live Zoom Q&A session on set times (1 hour per week).
- To attend to students individually, turn on the waiting room option, and let students in one-by-one.
- Alternatively, you can schedule a Canvas Live-Chat session of 30-45 min for students to raise questions. Students can then review the questions and answers of other students too.
- Finally, you have the option of opening a Canvas Discussion Board for students to raise and upvote questions. Try to answer them on set times.
