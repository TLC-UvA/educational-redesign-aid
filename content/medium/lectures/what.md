Your options here are **pre-recorded** or **live** lectures. Choose pre-recorded for larger and/or more international groups (in different time zones). Choose live lectures to increase student engagement and interaction. This also helps you and your students to stay connected throughout the course.

Also, we recommend that you use your first lecture to explain to students what you expect (e.g. Zoom etiquette for students), show them around, and walk them through the online course. Or record an introduction video on this, which you can refer back to. See our “Getting Started” tips [here](../#tips).

#### PRE-RECORDED LECTURE
If you choose to go for pre-recorded lectures, you have two options: 1) if you have a previously recorded web-lecture, turn them into segments, or 2) you can record a new lecture. Aim for a maximum of 15-minutes per video and 45 minutes of total content to replace a 2-hour lecture. Here’s how to do it.

#### PRE-RECORDED WEB-LECTURE
1. Check if the technical quality of your web-lecture is high enough (think of audio and visual quality, like do you move out of sight, are students’ questions repeated, is the whiteboard readable, etc.). If the technical quality is sufficient, continue to step 2. Otherwise, record a new lecture (see below).
2. Identify the segments (not the entire lecture!) in your web-lecture that you want students to watch. Write down the start time and end time. If possible, break down your web-lecture into segments of 10 to 15 minutes based on (sub)topics.
3. Go to the web-lecture link-generator. Copy and paste the link to your web-lecture in the link-generator. For each segment, add the start time and end time and generate the link. Copy the generated link.
4. Past the link on Canvas and adjust the settings (e.g., make them available at a set time each week).

#### PRE-RECORDED NEW LECTURE
1. Record your slideshow in PowerPoint or Canvas (Kaltura Capture).
2. Upload the links or videos to Canvas for viewing and adjust the settings (e.g., make them available at a set time each week).

#### NEXT IN CANVAS
1. For each video, label with topic name instead of only numbering the videos. This helps students find relevant material when they want to re-watch a video.
2. Add clear instructions for your students. For example, indicate when students should watch it, add a question, what to look for and/or and what they should be able to do or know afterwards. This way you activate your students while they watch your videos.
3. Provide a Discussion Board for students to comment on the videos. Add a probe question or ask students to come up with a content-related question to get the discussion started. Consider awarding a bonus point for forum contributions and/or upvotes.
4. To keep your students connected and engaged, answer their questions in some manner; Check back on the Discussion Board regularly and reply to students’ questions in the Discussion Board, in a live Canvas chat session or in a short video before the next lecture.

#### LIVE LECTURE
1. Schedule a Zoom meeting in Canvas for 120 min.
2. Aim for a total of 90-min. presentation (content) time. To make this manageable for all, split the presentation into three blocks of 30 min. with 10-min. breaks in-between.
3. To interact with your students you can use Zoom polls and chat for questions.
