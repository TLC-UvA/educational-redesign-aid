*Prerecorded Lectures*: With larger audiences, more students might encounter technical problems, which prevent them from (completely) following live lectures. In those cases, pre-recorded lectures are the way to go. We advise you not to copy-paste weblectures as they are, since this has been a source of complaints by students. Therefore we recommend to check the quality first and then select segments, based on subtopics. In addition, when you add viewing instructions you encourage your students to watch the videos in a ‘learning mode’. By adding a Discussion Board, you also leave room for questions and answers. Furthermore, it provides you with feedback on what to address further. A Discussion Board does need some encouragement for your students to participate. For example with an assignment to post or upvote, with your responses to their questions and by showing that you’re there from time to time. If you want to increase interaction and connection with your students from a distance, check the level up tips.

*Prerecorded or Live Sessions*: Attending online sessions, whether pre-recorded or live, takes up a lot of the participants’ energy, including your own. You want your students to be in a ‘learning mode’ (active processing) instead of a ‘watching tv mode’ (passive processing). Therefore, your live sessions are shorter and with more breaks in between than in an offline setting. The same goes for watching recorded videos. Shorter videos allows your students to process the content and view each video with enough headspace. The shorter the videos, the more video content students will actually watch. Plus, the longer the videos, the larger the file size, the upload time and playback time. At the same time, let’s be pragmatic too, sometimes things take a bit longer to explain and some segments will be longer than others. Don’t let that ruin your day.
