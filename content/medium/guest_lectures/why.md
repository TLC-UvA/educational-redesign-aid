Interaction through an online *plenary* Zoom session is often more difficult to achieve. Students tend to fall back into ‘watching tv mode’ (passive processing). By raising and upvoting questions prior to the interactive session, your students are more engaged and in ‘learning mode’ (active processing). You can augment this with Zoom polls to provide your guest with the opportunity to get to know the audience and interact with them in a fast and efficient way. Zoom polls also keep your students in an active learning mode and foster engagement too, and provide a more lively experience overall.
