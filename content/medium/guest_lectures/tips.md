- Add a cliff-hanger to the pre-recorded one-on-one interview. For example, if your guest has a real life example, don’t tell the end of the story yet until the live session. Use the Canvas Discussion Board to ask students what they would do next, before your guest continues the story.
- Add a short quiz to the introduction video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess students’ understanding of the subject matter, to have your guest raise a question, or to have students think about what they would do in a real life example. This way you activate your students while they watch the interview and foster information processing. Plus, you and your guest get feedback on what students (mis)understand.
