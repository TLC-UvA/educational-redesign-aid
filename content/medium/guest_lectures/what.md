1. Record a short one-on-one introduction interview using Zoom. Aim for 15-30 min max.
2. Upload the interview to Canvas for viewing as part of structured self-study:
3. Provide a Discussion Board for students to add comments and ask questions after viewing. Next, invite students to upvote their favorite questions and comments.
4. Schedule a live Zoom session in Canvas for an interactive Q&A session of 90 min max, relying on the content from the Discussion Board.
5. Introduce your guest and hand over the lecture (5 min.). Reserve a maximum of 45-min presentation time and a minimum of 30 min for questions and answers (more is better). Split the session into three blocks of 30-20-30 min with 10-min breaks in-between.
6. To interact with the students you can use Zoom chat and Zoom polls for questions, as well as the content from the Discussion Board..
7. As a co-host you, or a teaching assistant, can moderate the questions during presentation time and/or take the lead in the Q&A part, by interviewing your guest with the questions asked in the chat.
